# Voice Assistant Configuration Example
# Copy this file to config.yaml and fill in your actual values

# OpenAI API Configuration
openai:
  api_key: "your-openai-api-key-here"  # Replace with your actual API key
  model: "gpt-realtime"  # OpenAI Realtime API model

# Audio Configuration
audio:
  device: "ac108"  # ALSA device name for ReSpeaker 4-Mic Array
  sample_rate: 16000  # Hz
  channels: 1  # Use mono (AC108 supports this and works perfectly with openWakeWord)
  chunk_size: 1280  # Samples per chunk (80ms at 16kHz - required by openWakeWord)
  output_device: null  # Preferred output device name (partial match, case-insensitive)
                       # Examples: "JBL", "Bluetooth", "Speaker", "Headphones"
                       # If null or not found, falls back to system default
                       # Use `python -m voice_assistant.commands.list_audio_devices` to see available devices

# Hotword Detection Configuration
hotword:
  model: "alexa"  # Wake word model
  threshold: 0.5  # Detection threshold (0.0-1.0)
  # Lower threshold = more sensitive (more false positives)
  # Higher threshold = less sensitive (more false negatives)

# Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Configuration
vad:
  aggressiveness: 3  # VAD aggressiveness level (0-3)
  # 0 = least aggressive (detects any sound)
  # 3 = most aggressive (only clear speech)
  # Recommended: 3 to avoid false triggers from taps/movements
  
  speech_threshold: 3  # Consecutive speech frames required (filters brief noises)
  # Higher = more strict (ignores short sounds like taps)
  # Lower = more sensitive (may trigger on brief noises)
  
  silence_threshold: 15  # Silent frames before voice considered stopped
  # ~1 second at 80ms per chunk
  # Higher = waits longer before stopping

# Logging Configuration
logging:
  level: "INFO"  # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
  format: "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"

# State Machine Configuration
state:
  timeout_listening: 10  # Seconds to wait in LISTENING before timeout
  timeout_processing: 30  # Seconds to wait in PROCESSING before timeout
